# Combat Economics - A Gamified Barter Framework for Combat Sports

An experimental gamified system for alternative value exchange in combat sports, designed to rethink income, trade, and cultural capital.

## What’s Inside
- **The Framework**: A structured approach to building a survival-focused barter portfolio for fighters and stakeholders.
- **The Game**: A dynamic system where users strategize, trade, and level up their assets in a simulated barter economy.
- **Resources**: Downloadable JSON/Excel files of 50 categorized assets with ratings for trade value, prep time, and more.

## Why a Gamified Barter System?
